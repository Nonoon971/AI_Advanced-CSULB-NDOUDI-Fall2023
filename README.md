# AI_Advanced-CSULB-NDOUDI-Fall2023
List of the assignment done during the Fall 2023 Artificial Intelligence Advanced class

### Assignment 1 - Optimizing Airport Locations Using Gradient Descent
In this assignment, the objective was to solve the n-airports problem, which involves determining the optimal locations for a set of airports to minimize the total distance to a set of cities. The solution was implemented using a gradient-based optimization algorithm in Python. 

The assignment required:
* Defining an objective function to calculate the distance between airports and cities.
* Applying gradient descent to iteratively adjust airport positions for minimizing the objective function.
* Visualizing the optimization process through a plot showing how the objective values change over time.

### Assignment 2 - Introduction to Neural Networks with Python: Classification and Regression
This assignment focuses on getting hands-on experience with fundamental deep learning concepts and neural network implementation using Python. 

It involved:
* Understanding the basics of neural networks.
* Reproducing three example programs that demonstrate different types of machine learning problems:
    * Binary Classification: Classifying movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments (bin_class.ipynb)
    * Multiclass Classification: Categorizing newswires into multiple classes (mul_class.ipynb).
    * Regression: Predicting house prices based on various features (reg.ipynb).

The assignment highlights key deep learning tasks including data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation in Python.
